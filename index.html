              <p>I’m the middle one of three brothers. One majored in chemistry and the other in creative writing. Since I wasn’t ready to commit to either the hard sciences or the humanities, I tried my hand at Interior Design, Religious Studies, and Psychology. I also took a variety of career routes: coaching, teaching, wine merchant, and, most recently, adolescent psychiatric specialist. So far, none of them has been just right for me. I’ve always enjoyed computers and am an incurable Apple-holic, owning the Macbook Pro, the HomePod, the Apple Iphone, Ipad and watch. All this means that I’m either confused or really curious about a lot of things.</p>

              <p>On my own time, I enjoy movies, playing Heroes of the Storm, and watching Grand Tour on t.v.  I also find myself frequently disappearing down rabbit holes, watching a wide range of tech sites on YouTube. That’s where you’ll find me, up until the wee hours. Sleeping is not one of my accomplishments. My goal is to put together my background in design and my love of computers and technology to build a new career in web development.
